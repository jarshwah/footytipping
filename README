Warning
-------
This was a personal project at work from 2011. It should *not* be used as-is
for any purposes what-so-ever. It does not represent best practises established
over the years since. It probably didn't represent best practises at the time
either. I've learned a lot since then :)

I don't even know what version of Django I was originally targeting, since I
apparently installed from the SVN trunk.

Installation Instructions
----------------------------------

Dependencies
=======================
  * django-uni-form

    If you're using pip and virtualenv, there is a requirements file within the tipping/ directory that you can
    use for installation:

      pip install -E <your virtualenv> -r path/to/tipping/requirements.txt

    Otherwise, follow the installation instructions at django-uni-form:

      https://github.com/pydanny/django-uni-form


Apps
=======================

Add 'tipping' and 'uni_form' to INSTALLED_APPS:

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        'django.contrib.auth',
        'django.contrib.contenttypes',
        'django.contrib.sessions',
        'django.contrib.sites',
        'django.contrib.admin',
        #...

        'tipping',
        'uni_form',
    )


Static Files
=======================

Configure the STATIC media in one of two ways.


  1. The first would be preferred, but is only available from Django >= 1.3 (See the below notes for django-uni-form):

    # ensure that AppDirectoriesFinder is included in STATICFILES_FINDERS
    STATICFILES_FINDERS = (
        'django.contrib.staticfiles.finders.FileSystemFinder',
        'django.contrib.staticfiles.finders.AppDirectoriesFinder',
    )

    # then run the management command below from a command prompt:
    python manage.py collectstatic


  2. The other way is to symlink or copy the required media to your STATIC_ROOT directory. This is actually required for django-uni-forms until they rename their `media` folder to `static`. There is currently an issue open for django-uni-forms regarding this (https://github.com/pydanny/django-uni-form/issues#issue/59):

    cp -r </path/to>/tipping/static/tipping </path/to/STATIC_ROOT>/
    cp -r </path/to/django-uni-form>/uni_form/media/uni_form </path/to/STATIC_ROOT>/


Templates
=======================

Ensure templates can be loaded correctly by enabling 'django.template.loaders.app_directories.Loader' as an option in TEMPLATE_LOADERS. Or, you can symlink/copy to your templates directory if you like, in a similar manner to the static files option above.
